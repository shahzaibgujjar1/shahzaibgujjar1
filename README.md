# 🐶 Case Study: Scaling a Pet Care Brand (Lavender Dog Spray)

### **Project Overview**
**Product:** Lavender Oil Dog Deodorizing & Calming Spray
**Objective:** Launch a new product in a competitive market and generate profitable sales (ROAS).
**My Role:** Meta Ads Strategist & Media Buyer.

---

## 1. The Challenge (Problem) 🛑
The client had a high-quality organic product but was struggling to get sales.
* **Problem:** The market is flooded with generic "dog perfumes."
* **Pain Point:** Pet owners didn't trust that a spray could actually remove "wet dog smell" without harming the pet's skin.
* **Goal:** We needed to prove it's safe, effective and has a dual benefit (Smell + Anxiety Relief).

---

## 2. My Strategy & Research 🧠

### **Phase 1: Competitor Analysis & USP**
I analyzed 5 top competitors and found a gap: Most were selling "Perfume."
**My Angle:** I positioned this product as **"Therapy in a Bottle"**  solving both the bad smell *and* the dog's anxiety (e.g., during thunderstorms or car rides).

### **Phase 2: Building the Buyer Persona**
I didn't just target "Dog Lovers." I created a specific avatar:
* **Avatar:** "The Empathetic Dog Mom."
* **Demographics:** Women, 25-45, USA.
* **Interests:** Dog grooming, Dog behavior, Natural products, Caesar Millan.
* **Pain Points:** Embarrassed by house smell when guests arrive; worried about their dog's stress.

## 3. The Execution (Ad Setup) ⚙️

### **The Funnel Structure**
* **Top of Funnel (TOF):** Broad targeting + Interest stack (Pet Smart, Chewy).
* **Middle of Funnel (MOF):** Retargeting video viewers (50%) with a "Social Proof" ad (Reviews).
* **Bottom of Funnel (BOF):** Dynamic Catalog Sales for "Add to Cart" abandoners.

### **Ad Creative Strategy (A/B Testing)**
I tested two different hooks to see what worked best:
* **Creative A (The Problem Solver):** "Does your house smell like 'Wet Dog'?" (Focus: Hygiene)
* **Creative B (The Emotional Hook):** "Help your pup relax while smelling amazing." (Focus: Calming)

### **Winning Ad Copy ✍️**
*The "Calming" angle performed 40% better. Here is the copy I used:*

"I A/B tested 5 different variations. The following copy had the highest Click-Through-Rate (CTR) because it tapped into the owner's emotion:"

# Project 2: Google Search Ads (Capturing the Demand)

**Objective:**
While Facebook Ads were great for creating awareness, I needed to capture the people who were actively searching for a solution on Google. These are the "hot leads" ready to buy.

**My Approach & Strategy:**
Instead of bidding on generic and expensive keywords like "dog perfume," I focused on the actual problem. I targeted specific phrases like "stop wet dog smell" and "safe dog deodorant spray." This ensured that my ad only appeared when someone was genuinely looking for help, not just browsing pictures of dogs.

**Money Saving Move (Negative Keywords):**
To make sure the client's budget wasn't wasted, I immediately blocked keywords like "homemade," "DIY," "recipe," and "cheap." I didn't want clicks from people looking for free solutions. I only wanted people with credit cards in hand.

**The Ad Copy:**
For the headlines, I didn't just list features. I asked questions that the user was thinking, like "Can't get rid of that wet dog smell?" followed by our solution "100% Natural Lavender Spray." This direct relevance is why our Quality Score stayed high (9/10), which made our clicks cheaper than the competitors.

**The Results:**
Because we targeted high-intent searches, the conversion rate was higher than Facebook.
* **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** 5.1x
* **Conversion Rate:** 6.8%
* **Cost Per Click (CPC):** Reduced by 30% due to high Quality Score.

This campaign proved that while Facebook creates the want, Google captures the sale.

# Project 3: Premium Cat Food Scaling (ACANA Indoor Entrée)

**Objective:**
Selling premium pet food is tricky because it's more expensive than supermarket brands. My goal was not just to get a one-time sale, but to acquire a loyal customer who would buy this food every month. We used a "Hybrid Strategy" combining Facebook for awareness and Google for sales.

**The Challenge:**
Most cat owners buy cheap generic food. We needed to educate them on *why* ACANA (Chicken, Turkey & Rabbit) is worth the extra money. Specifically, we had to target "Indoor Cats" who struggle with weight gain and hairballs.

**My Meta Ads Strategy (The "Health" Angle):**
On Facebook and Instagram, I didn't just show the bag of food. I focused on the problem: "Is your indoor cat gaining too much weight?"
* **Visuals:** I used scroll-stopping videos showing active, healthy cats versus lethargic ones.
* **The Hook:** "Your indoor cat needs a special diet." This called out the specific audience immediately.
* **Targeting:** I went after specific interests like "Jackson Galaxy" (Cat behaviorist) and "Raw feeding," as these people care deeply about nutrition.

**My Google Ads Strategy (Shopping & Search):**
For Google, I used **Google Shopping Ads** so people could see the product image and price before clicking.
* **Keywords:** I targeted high-intent terms like "best dry food for indoor cats" and "grain-free cat food for weight control."
* **Brand Bidding:** I also bid on the brand name "Acana" to protect our traffic from competitors trying to steal our customers.

**The Results (High LTV):**
The magic of this campaign was the recurring purchases.
* **ROAS:** 3.8x on the front end.
* **Customer Retention:** 40% of buyers returned for a second bag within 45 days.
* **Cost Per Acquisition:** Stabilized at $12, which was profitable because each customer buys $500+ worth of food per year.

This project showed that for premium products, educating the customer on "Ingredients" (Rabbit, Herring) works better than just offering a discount.
