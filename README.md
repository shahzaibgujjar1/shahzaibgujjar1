# 🐶 Case Study: Scaling a Pet Care Brand (Lavender Dog Spray)

### **Project Overview**
**Product:** Lavender Oil Dog Deodorizing & Calming Spray
**Objective:** Launch a new product in a competitive market and generate profitable sales (ROAS).
**My Role:** Meta Ads Strategist & Media Buyer.

---

## 1. The Challenge (Problem) 🛑
The client had a high-quality organic product but was struggling to get sales.
* **Problem:** The market is flooded with generic "dog perfumes."
* **Pain Point:** Pet owners didn't trust that a spray could actually remove "wet dog smell" without harming the pet's skin.
* **Goal:** We needed to prove it's safe, effective and has a dual benefit (Smell + Anxiety Relief).

## 2. My Strategy & Research 🧠

### **Phase 1: Competitor Analysis & USP**
I analyzed 5 top competitors and found a gap: Most were selling "Perfume."
**My Angle:** I positioned this product as **"Therapy in a Bottle"**  solving both the bad smell *and* the dog's anxiety (e.g., during thunderstorms or car rides).

### **Phase 2: Building the Buyer Persona**
I didn't just target "Dog Lovers." I created a specific avatar:
* **Avatar:** "The Empathetic Dog Mom."
* **Demographics:** Women, 25-45, USA.
* **Interests:** Dog grooming, Dog behavior, Natural products, Caesar Millan.
* **Pain Points:** Embarrassed by house smell when guests arrive; worried about their dog's stress.

## 3. The Execution (Ad Setup) ⚙️

### **The Funnel Structure**
* **Top of Funnel (TOF):** Broad targeting + Interest stack (Pet Smart, Chewy).
* **Middle of Funnel (MOF):** Retargeting video viewers (50%) with a "Social Proof" ad (Reviews).
* **Bottom of Funnel (BOF):** Dynamic Catalog Sales for "Add to Cart" abandoners.

### **Ad Creative Strategy (A/B Testing)**
I tested two different hooks to see what worked best:
* **Creative A (The Problem Solver):** "Does your house smell like 'Wet Dog'?" (Focus: Hygiene)
* **Creative B (The Emotional Hook):** "Help your pup relax while smelling amazing." (Focus: Calming)

### **Winning Ad Copy ✍️**
*The "Calming" angle performed 40% better. Here is the copy I used:*

"I A/B tested 5 different variations. The following copy had the highest Click-Through-Rate (CTR) because it tapped into the owner's emotion:"
